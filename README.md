# UTS 31080 Interactive Media - Media Project
The main media project for Interactive Media Spring 2018.
Our goal was to create an interactive project to encourage physical interaction from users in a fun and engaging way.
We set out to achieve this through creating "Human Tetris", a blend of the classic arcade game Tetris, and the gameshow Hole in the Wall.

The player must move their body into the shape displayed on-screen before a timer runs out, and must continue making the differents shapes for as long as they can.

# To Play
You'll need to run 'Human_Tetris.pde' from inside the Human_Tetris folder within processing. Before starting the code, make sure you have setup the Kinect sensor properly, with the SDK installed. Then all you have to do is stand in your play space infront of the Kinect sensor, and last as long as you can!

# Requirements
* Processing 3
* Microsoft XBox 360 Kinect V1
* Microsoft Kinect V1 SDK
* 3-5 meters of space in front of the Kinect sensor
